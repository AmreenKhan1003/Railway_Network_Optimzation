# Railway_Network_Optimzation

Console application built using Dijkstra's algorithm in C++ language. Application is capable of optimizing and providing a path having minimum distance between source to destination stations of railways.

## Features:

- Calculates the shortest path between two railway stations using Dijkstra's algorithm.
- Optimizes train scheduling to minimize travel time and avoid conflicts.
- Provides a user-friendly interface for input and visualization of railway networks.
- Supports custom network configurations and constraints.

## IDE:

### Visual Studio

## Data Structure used:

- struct
- vector
- set

## Graph

Present in the code.

Users can change the graph data by building their own adjacency list.

## Input

Please enter source: 0

Please enter your destination: 8

## Output

The shortest path from 0 to 8 is:

CSMT -> Vadala -> Kurla -> Thane

Total distance: 38
