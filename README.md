# Railway_Network_Optimzation
### Console application built using Dijkstra's algorithm in C++ language. Application is capable of optimizing and providing a path having minimum distance between source to destination stations of railways.

## Features:
- Calculates the shortest path between two railway stations using Dijkstra's algorithm.
- Optimizes train scheduling to minimize travel time and avoid conflicts.
- Provides a user-friendly interface for input and visualization of railway networks.
- Supports custom network configurations and constraints.

## IDE:
### Visual Studio

## Data Structure used:
- struct
- vector
- set

## Graph
